# Open Standards for Sensorimotor Modeling (OSSM)

The **OSSM ecosystem** is a community-driven effort to standardize and accelerate research in computational sensorimotor neuroscience. It is supported by the [NWO Open Science Fund](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-science/open-science-fund). OSSM provides **open standards, tools, and catalogues** for building, sharing, and analyzing models of the sensorimotor system.

## Install the entire ecosystem

Requires **Python 3.11+**. Download the suite and run:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Core Packages

- [`ossm-base`](https://github.com/ossm-team/ossm-base) – shared types and utilities  
- [`ossm-models`](https://github.com/ossm-team/ossm-models) – model catalogue & Sensorimotor Modeling Standard (SMS)  
- [`ossm-tasks`](https://github.com/ossm-team/ossm-tasks) – task catalogue & Sensorimotor Task and Environment Format (STEF)  
- [`ossm-lab`](https://github.com/ossm-team/ossm-lab) – analysis lab with standardized pipelines and benchmarks  

## Vision

OSSM ensures that models, tasks, and analyses are **interoperable, reusable, and comparable** across labs and projects. The goal is to establish a **unified, open research paradigm** in which neuroscientific models and benchmarks are continuously shared and improved.
